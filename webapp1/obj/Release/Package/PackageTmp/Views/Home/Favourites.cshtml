                The Avengers team, with a focus on Thor, travels to Mars to investigate an ancient site related to Asgardian history, which turns out
                to be a portal to another realm ruled by the powerful villain Ex Nihilo. New characters, such as Abyss and Nightmask, are introduced, and
                they are revealed to be connected to Ex Nihilo's plans for Earth. Meanwhile, back on Earth, Captain America and the remaining Avengers work
                to contain the effects of the portal's opening. Avengers #7 is part of writer Jonathan Hickman's larger narrative exploring the cosmic side
                of the Marvel Universe and the implications of the expanded Avengers roster, and features visually stunning artwork by Dustin Weaver
